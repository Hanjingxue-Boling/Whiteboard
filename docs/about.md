## About Me üëã

I am Hanjingxue Boling (ÂØíÊô∂Èõ™‚Ä¢ÈìÇÁÅµ), one of the Chinese translators of openSUSE news, and all articles are published under [CC-BY-SA 3.0/4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license if not otherwise stated. Since it is not possible to perform a password update on [this wiki account](https://zh.opensuse.org/User:Aua0880) to apply a more secure password. If you notice unusual behavior from this user, please contact an administrator or me as soon as possible.

I use Win10 on a daily basis and use Fedora Linux at the same time (Only insider [virtual machine](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html)). I am also not a developer.

Now, I am mainly translating [openSUSE news](https://suse.org.cn/).

>Additional Notes:
>
>You can call me Hanjingxue Boling, Hanjingxue, Boling H. or Boling Hanjingxue. the order doesn't matter because the virtual name doesn't include the last name.
